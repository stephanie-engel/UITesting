# UITesting

1. Created this repo so I can experiment with UI automation using Java / Selenium WebDriver / TestNg.
2. The page object getters, setters, and locators were created via Lombok (for speed and simplicity)
3. Per the Lombok website, page objects can be reverted to the conventional locator, getters, and setters layout via the 'delombok' command: https://projectlombok.org/features/delombok.html
